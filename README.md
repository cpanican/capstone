## Overview
This is a software that could allow for hand gestures to control a computer with the use of a camera in a way similar to the mouse. We will apply various machine learning algorithms to allow for the recognition of hand gestures. The user can set custom gestures by allowing to pick any combination of number of fingers and detectable gestures.

## How to run the app
